Installation
------------
Please review this document and the RELEASE document prior to installing OJS.
If you encounter problems, please also see the FAQ document in this directory.

To install OJS:

        1. Extract the OJS archive to the desired location in your web
           documents directory.

        2. Make the following files and directories (and their contents)
           writeable (i.e., by changing the owner or permissions with chown or
           chmod):

             * config.inc.php (optional -- if not writable you will be prompted
               to manually overwrite this file during installation)
             * public
             * cache
             * cache/t_cache
             * cache/t_config
             * cache/t_compile
             * cache/_db

        3. Create a directory to store uploaded files (submission files, etc.)
           and make this directory writeable. It is recommended that this
           directory be placed in a non-web-accessible location (or otherwise
           protected from direct access, such as via .htaccess rules).

        4. Review and apply the patches recommended for your version of OJS.

           Starting with OJS version 2.3.3-2, the Public Knowledge Project
           development team maintains a publicly-available list of recommended
           patches for each release. These will add no new functionality and
           will typically consist of small, easy-to-read patches for specific
           issues. A Recommended Patches list for your version of OJS  can
           be found on the PKP development wiki:

               <http://pkp.sfu.ca/wiki/index.php/OJS_Recommended_Patches>

           To apply a recommended patch, open the bug report and download the
           attached patch file(s). (Note that bug reports can quite often include
           a number of patches, some relevant to the application (ie. OJS) and
           version you are running, and some not. Ensure that you download all
           and only the patches specific to your application and version.) For
           each patch you download, first attempt a dry-run application of the
           patch, to ensure that it applies cleanly:

               $ patch -p1 --dry-run < PATCH_FILE
